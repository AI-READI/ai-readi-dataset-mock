## Overview of the study
The Artificial Intelligence Ready and Equitable Atlas for Diabetes Insights (AI-READI) project seeks to create a flagship ethically-sourced dataset to enable future generations of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) research to provide critical insights into type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including salutogenic pathways to return to health. The ability to understand and affect the course of complex, multi-organ diseases such as T2DM has been limited by a lack of well-designed, high quality, large, and inclusive multimodal datasets. The AI-READI team of investigators will aim to collect a cross-sectional dataset of 4,000 people and longitudinal data from 10% of the study cohort across the US. The study cohort will be balanced for self-reported race/ethnicity, gender, and diabetes disease stage. Data collection will be specifically designed to permit downstream pseudo-time manifold analysis, an approach used to predict disease trajectories by collecting and learning from complex, multimodal data from participants with differing disease severity (normal to insulin-dependent T2DM). The long-term objective for this project is to develop a foundational dataset in T2DM, agnostic to existing classification criteria or biases, which can be used to reconstruct a temporal atlas of T2DM development and reversal towards health (i.e., salutogenesis). Six cross-disciplinary project modules involving teams located across eight institutions will work together to develop this flagship dataset. Data will be optimized for downstream AI/ML research and made publicly available. This project will also create a roadmap for ethical and equitable research that focuses on the diversity of the research participants and the workforce involved at all stages of the research process (study design and data collection, curation, analysis, and sharing and collaboration).

## Description of the dataset
This dataset contain data from 204 participants from the pilot period of the project (July 19, 2023 to November 30, 2023). Data from multiple modalities are included. A full list is provided in the "Data Standards" section below. The data in this dataset contain no personel health information (PHI).  

The dataset contains a total of 1,265 files (including data and metadata files) and is 420 GB in size.

A detailed description of the dataset is available at [docs.aireadi.org](https://docs.aireadi.org/).

## Data standards followed
This dataset is organized at the highest-level following the [Clinical Dataset Structure](https://github.com/AI-READI/high-level-dataset-structure). Each data type was organized according to either an existing standard if vailable for that data type or a newly developed one if no community agreed standard was found. Details are provided in the table below.

| Data type      | Standards followed |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Electrocardiogram      | [X standard]()       |
| Optical Coherence Tomography   | [Y standard]()      |

## Resources
All of our data files are in formats that are accessible with free software commonly used for such data types so no specific software is required.
