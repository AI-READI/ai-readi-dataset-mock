## About
This repository provides a template of the AI-READI dataset. It is meant to provide a place for the AI-READI team to workout the details of the structure of the data and metadata files in the dataset. It is also meant to provide an overview of the AI-READI dataset as well as an in-depth understanding of its structure to potential reusers of the dataset outside of the AI-READI team.

## Specifications
The template of the AI-READI dataset will evolve as the standards we follow for data and metadata evolve. The latest template is available [here](main). 

## Structure of this repository
Each version of the AI-READI dataset template is stored in a dedicated folder under the `versions` folder. The `main` folder contain a copy of the latest released version where edits/suggestions can be made via pull request. At the time of the release of a new version of the template, the version in the `main` folder will be copied in the `versions` folder and renamed after the new version number. Changes between the different versions are tracked in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file.
